# Sketch Challenge

This is a simple viewer for Sketch documents

The latest version of this app is currently deployed [here](https://sketch-challenge.vercel.app/)

## How to run it locally

This project uses yarn, run:
`yarn install` to install dependencies

To start the development environment, you will need to create a .env.local file
with your root api route `API_ROUTE=<YOURAPIROUTE>`
After that you can run:
`yarn dev`

For running tests run:
`yarn test`
You can keep this running on a separate terminal and it will run everytime a test is updated.
